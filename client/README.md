# AMAZING IOT 

Thanks to my **amazing code** <br>
YOU CAN <br>
control an LED (or a tubelight) from a remote location.

You only need ***A RASPBERRY PI.***

**STEPS TO RUN:**

1. Save ./server folder to server machine.
2. Save ./client folder to raspberry pi.
3. Run npm install on both.
4. Change server URL at client.js. ()

5. Run npm start on both. (Or use pm2 or nodemon)
6. Open http://SERVER_ADDRESS:3001 in browser and control the LED.

**IN THE FUTURE:**

1.Will add a circuit for connecting an actual tubelight if I actually do it. 
2. Might add an arduino version.
